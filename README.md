## About

A simple Dungeons and Dragons virtual tabletop. Upload a map and add customizable character pieces that you can drag around the map.

Everything is saved locally to your browser.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Click character pieces (or tab to them and press Space or Enter) to select them and press the arrow keys to move them around and scroll the window at the same time.

If you want to move the character pieces without scrolling the window, hold down "Shift" and use the arrow keys.

Press ESC to deselect all character pieces, or click off.

## Colophon

Built using Vanilla JS and [Reef](https://reefjs.com/).

Styled using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Bundled using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

Character icons are from [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/).

Need to use `Node v14.17.0` or above.

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run locally:

```
npm run start
```

Build for production:

```
npm run build
```

### Notes

If you get a `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` error, you're probably using a version of Node that's too old
